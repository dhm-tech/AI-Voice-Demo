# 🎙️ AI Voice Demo (Python)

A simple Python project that showcases how to convert an audio file into text using OpenAI Whisper, generate a funny AI response, and convert it back into speech using OpenAI’s TTS.
In a points:
1. Converts an audio file into text using OpenAI Whisper  
2. Generates AI-based response  
3. Converts that response back to speech using OpenAI's realistic TTS

## 🎯 Project Goal  

Learn how to:
- Transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper  
- Generate responses with **LLMs** (Large Language Models like ChatGPT)  
- Use **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** to synthesize natural AI voices  
- Secure API keys using environment variables  
- Package and document a small AI pipeline

## 🧱 What We Did

We wrote a single Python script, **`main.py`**, that can:

1. **Transcribe** – take any audio file (e.g. `.m4a`) and convert it to plain text using OpenAI Whisper.  
2. **Respond** – either generate a custom reply using ChatGPT or insert a funny static message.  
3. **Speak** – use OpenAI’s TTS to synthesize the response into a realistic voice and save it as an `.mp3`.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  

- 🧠 OpenAI API (Whisper + GPT + TTS)
- 💬 GPT-3.5 Turbo (optional for dynamic replies)  
- 🔊 OpenAI TTS (`tts-1`, e.g. voice = `shimmer`)   
- 🐍 Python 3.8+  
- 📦 `openai` Python package  
- 🖥️ Tested on Windows 11

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Audio Transcription**  
   Using `client.audio.transcriptions.create(...)`, the audio file is converted into raw text via OpenAI’s `whisper-1` model.

2. **Custom Response Generation**  
   You can either:
   - Use a predefined funny message (like "This voice was generated by AI...").
   - Or generate a live reply from ChatGPT (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) using the transcribed text.

3. **Text-to-Speech**  
   The reply is converted to speech with `client.audio.speech.create(...)`, using natural-sounding voices such as `"shimmer"`, and saved as an `.mp3`.
